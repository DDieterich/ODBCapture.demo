## Overview

This repository is a demonstration of using [ODBCapture](http://ODBCapture.org)
to capture the source code from Oracle's Sample Schema

## Installation Instructions

### Sample Schema Installation:

*Note:* Sample build scripts are available for different versions of the Oracle database in the `builds` folder.

1. Copy these folders to a location with SQL\*Plus and SQL\*Loader.
    * custom_data_load
    * grb_linked_install_scripts
    * ss_src
2. Install Source Code
    1. Move to Installation Folder: `cd ss_src`
    2. Connect to Database as SYS: `sqlplus SYS/PASSWORD@TNS_ALIAS as sysdba`
    3. Run Main Installation Script: `@install.sql "SYSTEM/PASSWORD@TNS_ALIAS"`
    4. Run installation reports: `@report_status.sql "SYSTEM/PASSWORD"`
    5. Exit from SQL*Plus: `exit`
    6. Review results from installation reports
9. Install Custom Loaded Data
    1. Move to Installation Folder: `cd ../custom_data_load`
    2. Connect to Database as SYS: `sqlplus SYS/PASSWORD@TNS_ALIAS as sysdba`
    3. Run Main Installation Script: `@install.sql "SYSTEM/PASSWORD@TNS_ALIAS"`
    4. Run the installation reports: `@report_status.sql "SYSTEM/PASSWORD"`
    5. Exit from SQL*Plus: `exit`
    6. Review results from installation reports

### ODBCapture Installation

*Note:* The sample build scripts in the `builds` folder include these installations.

For each of the following folders, repeat steps 1 and 2 above, in this order:
1. grbsrc
2. grbsdo
3. grbxrep
4. ss_grb


## Generation/Capture Instructions

To generate the source code from the database after installation, log into the database as ODBCAPTURE and run these commands.  Some modification will be needed if:
* Not running on Linux
* Database cannot write to `/opt/install_files'

```
----------------------------------------
-- Sample Schema Capture
execute ODBCAPTURE.FH2.clear_buffers;
set serveroutput on size unlimited format word_wrapped
execute ODBCAPTURE.COMMON_UTIL.update_view_tabs;
execute ODBCAPTURE.GRAB_SCRIPTS.all_scripts('ss_src');
execute ODBCAPTURE.GRAB_SCRIPTS.all_scripts('ss_grb');
delete from zip_files where file_name = 'ss.zip';
execute ODBCAPTURE.FH2.write_scripts('ss.zip', '/opt/install_files');
commit;
```

After those commands are complete, there will be an `/opt/install_files/ss.zip` file ready.  The ZIP file will contain 2 folders that match the source code from the original:
* ss_src
* ss_grb

An alternative is to use `execute ODBCAPTURE.FH2.write_scripts('ss.zip');` instead, then download the ZIP file from the ODBCAPTURE.ZIP_FILES table.

SQL*Plus can be used to download a ZIP file from the database using [Ottmarâ€™s Notes](https://ogobrecht.com/posts/2020-01-01-download-blobs-with-sqlplus).
